# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-and-Classification-Using-Neural-Networks
This project aims to develop a robust system for the detection and classification of traffic signs using neural networks. The system utilizes two primary models, YOLOv8 for detection and ResNet-50 for classification, to process video data captured from the front of a vehicle.
